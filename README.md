## Assignment Overview

This assignment shows the implementation of Google Maps API heat maps with the comparison of fast food chains Hardees and Carls Jr. While these companies have the same logo and are technically the same restaurant, their name differs geographically. This maps shows the extent these chains operate within their boundaries and the density in which they operate. It's interesting how Carls Jr and Hardees both have locations in Wyoming and how Hardees wraps into Montana pushing further west. Enjoy the map!
